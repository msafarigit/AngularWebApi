//An NgModule is a class marked by the @NgModule decorator. @NgModule takes a metadata object that describes how to compile a component's template and
//how to create an injector at runtime.It identifies the module 's own components, directives, and pipes, making some of them public,
//through the exports property, so that external components can use them. @NgModule can also add service providers to the application dependency injectors.

//NgModules are classes decorated with @NgModule. The @NgModule decorator’s imports array tells Angular what other NgModules the current module needs.

//An NgModule describes how the application parts fit together. Every application has at least one Angular module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application. By convention, it is usually called AppModule.
//The @NgModule decorator identifies AppModule as an NgModule class. @NgModule takes a metadata object that tells Angular how to compile and launch the application.
//  declarations: this application's lone component.
//  imports: import BrowserModule to have browser specific services such as DOM rendering, sanitization, and location.
//  providers: the service providers.
//  bootstrap: the root component that Angular creates and inserts into the index.html host web page.

//Add declarable classes—components, directives, and pipes—to a declarations list.
//The root application module, AppModule, of almost every browser application should import BrowserModule from @angular/platform-browser.
//BrowserModule provides services that are essential to launch and run a browser app
//FormsModule: Exports the required providers and directives for template-driven forms, making them available for import by NgModules that import this module.
